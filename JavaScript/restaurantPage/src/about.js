                        <p>Loop Restaurant was founded in 2010 by chef Maria Rodriguez, who dreamed of creating a place where people could enjoy delicious comfort food in a warm, inviting atmosphere. What started as a small 30-seat eatery has grown into a neighborhood favorite, but we've never lost sight of our roots.</p>
                        <p>Maria's philosophy was simple: "Food should make you feel good, and the dining experience should make you feel at home." This guiding principle has shaped everything we do at Loop Restaurant.</p>

                        <h3 class="title">Our Philosophy</h3>
                        <p>We believe that great food begins with great ingredients. That's why we've developed relationships with local farmers and producers who share our commitment to quality and sustainability.</p>
                        <p>Our menu changes with the seasons, allowing us to showcase the best of what our region has to offer. From spring's first asparagus to autumn's hearty squash, we celebrate the natural rhythms of the land.</p>
